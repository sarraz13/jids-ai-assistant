            Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
            Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus 
            on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source.
            
            Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. 
            The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, 
            rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself (DRY).
            
            Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. 
            Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface 
            that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
